# Slot Machine Demo

1.  **Customizable Pop-up for Slot Game**
    
    -   A Vue.js component, `SlotGamePopup`, will be created for this. This component will consist of the following elements:
        -   Title and subtitle, specified in the JSON configuration.
        -   An image representing the slot machine game. The image should be large and central to grab the user's attention.
        -   A form, whose fields will be dynamically created based on the configuration in the JSON file. The form will be made using the Vue.js `v-form` and `v-text-field` components for input.
    -   Vue.js `props` will be used to pass the configuration JSON to the component.
2.  **Pop-up for Video Viewing**
    
    -   A Vue.js component, `VideoPopup`, will be created for this. This component will consist of the following elements:
        -   Title and subtitle, specified in the JSON configuration.
        -   An embedded video player, which plays the video from the URL specified in the JSON configuration.
        -   A form, just like in the `SlotGamePopup`.
    -   Vue.js `props` will be used to pass the configuration JSON to the component.

**Common Design Elements and Practices**

-   B.E.M. will be followed while structuring the CSS. For example, "popup" might be a block, "title" might be an element, and "active" might be a modifier, resulting in a CSS class like "popup__title--active".
    
-   A common Vue.js component, `DynamicForm`, will be created for generating forms dynamically. It will take as `props` the number of fields, and an array specifying the fields.
    
-   The checkbox for consent to data collection will be a Vue.js `v-checkbox` component.
    
-   To ensure perfect rendering on both desktop and mobile, responsive design principles will be followed. Vue.js' inbuilt grid system, similar to Bootstrap's, will be used for this. Media queries will also be used where necessary.
    
-   The popups will be designed as Vue.js `v-dialog` components. This allows them to be modal (overlaying the current page and focusing the user's interaction).
    

**Technology Stack**

-   Vue.js: Used for all the UI components. This is a JavaScript framework similar to React, but has some differences, such as a more opinionated structure, use of single-file components, and features like directives and mixins.
-   Axios: For any necessary HTTP requests.
-   Vue Router: For routing, if necessary.
-   Vuetify: For ready-to-use UI components in Vue.js. It provides components like forms, dialogs, and buttons, and follows Google's Material Design specifications.
-   Vuex: If shared state management is required, Vuex will be used. It's similar to Redux in React.

Please note that although the components have been described separately, they can be integrated into a single larger component with switchable states. This depends on how they will be used in the larger application.
